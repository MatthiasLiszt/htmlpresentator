generating presentations from markdown and html

## currently working

currently working is now the primitive html part without markdown conversion

### premises

* this html presentator requires jQuery

* you should have a div with class name "slide" for every slide 

* put presiconf.js at the end of the body

* don't forget to add presiconf.css

* there is currently a yellow selection bar which lets you select slide after slide

* you can load additional css and javascript files
